### What is Repl-Customs? 🤔

Repl Customs is a data solution I created to allow users to search the Repldatabase for custom data solutions. ~~That doesn't answer anything but OK~~ You can find out answers to questions like, "*How many upvotes does my post get in an hour?*" or "*Who commented the most in the past week?*" Things like this are easy to look at with Repl Customs!

### The Current State of Things. 📈
Repl Customs is still in development and the only features are looking up Repl users and getting a glorified profile page, looking up posts, and looking at the Repl leaderboard for cycles, but that is just the beginning! I want this to be a fully-fledged web app that is worth your time to visit. So look forward to constant updates and changes! I’ll be working on this for next few months. This is the list of upcoming features, https://github.com/IreTheKID/Repl-Customs/blob/master/upcoming.md.
